# Amazon-Clone
The intention of this project is to construct the frontend of an Amazon clone. We have designed product pages and listings, added cart systems and checkouts, all aimed to make the site feel as close to Amazon as it can possibly be.

We used HTML, CSS, and java scripts to make this site, which required complex responsive designs, dynamic DOM manipulations, as well as engaging user experience.

The listed features below show the scope of work put into this project:

---> Users can seamlessly toggle between the grid and listing view of the products
---> The Navigation Bar makes for easy and more effective browsing through the site
---> The use of minimal animations helps bring attention to the buttons, links, and images used
---> Taking into consideration the strength characteristics of works that compromise social infrastructures, this project provides an insight into UI development, detail-orientedness, and recreating a complex web 
     interface without the need for database connectivity or a payment integration system.

Our project uses a wide array of technologies and tools ranging from:

---> HTML5 (for overall project structure)
---> CSS3 (for responsive design)
---> Java scripts (for site interactivity)
